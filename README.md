# Change Data Capture With Pyflink
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of Change Data Capture (CDC) using Apache Flink with Python (PyFlink)

## What is Change Data Capture?
The main goal of CDC is to provide a mechanism to track and record changes made to data in a database, such as inserts, updates, and deletes, in real-time or near real-time.

This allows for use cases like data replication, ensuring that the target database remains in sync with the source database.

## Change Data Capture with Pyflink 
PyFlink is an Apache Flink Python API that provides a way to implement CDC using Flink's streaming data processing capabilities.
